# Title
Do news impact stock prices?

# Introduction & Goals
As I am investing on Warsw Stock Exchange (WSE), I noticed that price rises and drops coincide with some portals publishing positive or negative news more than others. I would like to investigate how most popular portals in Poland impact selected stock prices.

To do that I would like to answer the following questions:
1) Is it possible to react to news before they impact the prices? 
2) Are certain portal more negative or positive towards certain companies?
3) Is it possible to predict the general trend for stock prices based on the sentiment analysis of the news?

Data: 
    - biznesradar.pl not only has the information about the stock prices but also gathers the information from most important business news portals.

Tools:
    - Python - for webscrapping and analytics
