# Do news impact stock prices?

# Introduction & Goals
As I am investing on Warsw Stock Exchange (WSE), I noticed that price rises and drops coincide with some portals publishing positive or negative news more than others. I would like to investigate how most popular portals in Poland impact selected stock prices.

To do that I would like to answer the following questions:
1) Is it possible to react to news before they impact the prices? 
2) Are certain portal more negative or positive towards certain companies?
3) Is it possible to predict the general trend for stock prices based on the sentiment analysis of the news?

Data: 
    - biznesradar.pl not only has the information about the stock prices but also gathers the information from most important business news portals.

Tools:
    - Python - for webscrapping and analytics
    - Heroku - cloud platform to store the simple webpage containg the results for sample companies.

# Project Plan
Due to multiple options, I decided to split the project in 2 parts.

Analyze the trends for the stock price 1 week after the publication:
    1) without analyzing the news itself
    2) with analyzing the text (NLP)

# The Data Set

# Used Tools

# Demo
1. Execute the file
2. Type in the company code (f.e. ALE for Allegro, CDR for CD Project Red etc).
    Warning: some companies with long presence on the stock market might take long time to load (f.e. CDR). Date limiter will be added soon.
3. Enjoy the basic stock price graph with the main indicators (like SMA).
4. <work in progress> News analytics
