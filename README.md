# WSE_stock_and_news_scrapper

This project is aimed at answering the following questions:

- How news impact the stock prices?
- Are the websites biased towards certain companies?
- Is it possible to predict the general trend for stock prices based on the sentiment analysis of the news?

Data and news will be scrapped from BiznesRadar.pl.
